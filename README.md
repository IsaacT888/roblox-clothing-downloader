# roblox-clothing-downloader
Simple and easy to understand downloader. Is able to download single IDs and multiple/Bulk via a file.
It grabs the Item ID from a Link/URL so you don't have to worry about having to manually copy/paste the ID. Although both work.

Feel free to improve it and use this code as a base. Although credit for any project wether open-source or closed-source would be appreciated.
